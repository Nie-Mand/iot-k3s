# IoT Lab: K3s Lab

This lab is designed to be used with the [K3s](https://k3s.io/) distribution of Kubernetes. K3s is a lightweight, CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that is optimized for IoT and edge computing. It is a fully compliant Kubernetes distribution with the following enhancements:

## Note
For the simplicity of this lab, we will be using [K3d]](https://k3d.io/) instead of K3s. K3d is a lightweight wrapper to run K3s (Rancher Lab's minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker. It makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes-aware applications.
